<p>Reactions are organized into two parallel ontologies. Most reaction frames will have one<br> or more parents in both ontologies. The first classifies reactions by the nature of their<br> substrates, for example, small-molecule reactions are reactions in which all substrates are<br> small molecules, whereas protein reactions are reactions in which at least one substrate<br> is a protein. The second ontology classifies reactions by conversion type. For example,<br> chemical reactions are those in which a chemical transformation takes place, transport<br> reactions are those in which a substrate is transported from one compartment to another<br> (some reactions may be both transport reactions and chemical reactions if the substrate is<br> chemically altered during transport), and binding reactions are those in which substrates<br> weakly bind to each other to form a complex.<br> Two novel features of our conceptualization with respect to previous metabolic databases<br> are to separate reactions from the enzymes that catalyze them, and to use the EC numbers<br> defined by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) to<br> uniquely identify reactions, not enzymes. (In database terms, the EC number is a key<br> for the Reaction class.) The reason for this separation is that the catalyzes relationship<br> between reactions and enzymes is many-to-many: a given enzyme might catalyze more<br> than one reaction, and the same reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.<br> Frames in the class Enzymatic-Reaction describe the association between an enzyme and<br> a reaction. The entire EC taxonomy can be found under the Chemical-Reactions class.<br> You should always write transport reactions in the predominate direction in which the<br> reaction occurs. Transport reactions are encoded by labeling substrates with their abstract<br> (in vs. out) compartment. For example, if a given substrate is transported from the<br> periplasm to the cytosol, it would be labeled with “out” as its compartment as a reactant,<br> and with “in” as its compartment as a product. Please see the detailed discussion for the<br> Rxn-Locations slot. The default compartment is the cytosol, so the cytosol label may be<br> omitted for regular reactions. These labels are implemented as annotations in Ocelot.</p>

<h3 id="Properties"><a href="#Properties" class="headerlink" title="Properties"></a>Properties</h3><h4 id="DeltaG0"><a href="#DeltaG0" class="headerlink" title="DeltaG0"></a>DeltaG0</h4><p>This slot contains the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction in the direction the<br> reaction is written.</p>
<h4 id="ECNumber"><a href="#ECNumber" class="headerlink" title="ECNumber"></a>ECNumber</h4><p>This slot holds the EC (Enzyme Commission) number associated with the current reaction,<br> if such a number has been assigned by the IUBMB. This slot is single valued.</p>
<h4 id="EnzymesNotused"><a href="#EnzymesNotused" class="headerlink" title="EnzymesNotused"></a>EnzymesNotused</h4><p>Proteins or protein-RNA complexes listed in this slot are those which would otherwise<br> have been inferred to take part in the pathway or reaction, but which in reality do not. In<br> other words, the protein may catalyze a general reaction with non-specific substrates, but<br> is known not to catalyze this specific form of the reaction.</p>
<h4 id="Left"><a href="#Left" class="headerlink" title="Left"></a>Left</h4><p>These slots hold the compounds from the left and right sides, respectively, of the reaction<br> equation. Each value is either the key of a compound frame, or a string that names a<br> compound (when the compound is not yet described within the DB as a frame). The terms<br> reactant and product are not used because these terms may falsely imply the physiological<br> direction of the reaction.<br> The coefficient of each substrate, when that coefficient is not equal to 1, is stored as an<br> annotation on the substrate value. The annotation label is COEFFICIENT.<br> The substrates of transport reactions are also described using the Left and Right slots.<br> However, the values of these slots are annotated to indicate their compartments. For<br> example, a transporter that moves succinate from the periplasm to the cytosol, accompanied<br> by hydrolysis of ATP in the cytosol, would be described with succinate and ATP as<br> the values of the Left slot, and with succinate, ADP, and Pi as the values of the Right<br> slot. The succinate in the Left slot would be annotated with CCO-OUT under the label<br> Compartment. The other substrates need to be annotated with CCO-IN. Additionally, a<br> location has to be stored in the Rxn-Locations slot. Please see the detailed comments of<br> that slot.</p>
<h4 id="Right"><a href="#Right" class="headerlink" title="Right"></a>Right</h4><p>These slots hold the compounds from the left and right sides, respectively, of the reaction<br> equation. Each value is either the key of a compound frame, or a string that names a<br> compound (when the compound is not yet described within the DB as a frame). The terms<br> reactant and product are not used because these terms may falsely imply the physiological<br> direction of the reaction.<br> The coefficient of each substrate, when that coefficient is not equal to 1, is stored as an<br> annotation on the substrate value. The annotation label is COEFFICIENT.<br> The substrates of transport reactions are also described using the Left and Right slots.<br> However, the values of these slots are annotated to indicate their compartments. For<br> example, a transporter that moves succinate from the periplasm to the cytosol, accompanied<br> by hydrolysis of ATP in the cytosol, would be described with succinate and ATP as<br> the values of the Left slot, and with succinate, ADP, and Pi as the values of the Right<br> slot. The succinate in the Left slot would be annotated with CCO-OUT under the label<br> Compartment. The other substrates need to be annotated with CCO-IN. Additionally, a<br> location has to be stored in the Rxn-Locations slot. Please see the detailed comments of<br> that slot.</p>
<h4 id="RxnLocations"><a href="#RxnLocations" class="headerlink" title="RxnLocations"></a>RxnLocations</h4><p>This slot is used for storing information about the metabolite compartments of a reaction,<br> in the case where non-default compartments are involved. The default compartment is<br> defined as the frame CCO-CYTOSOL. There are two cases of reactions:</p>
<p> S: Reactions that have all of their metabolites in the same compartment.</p>
<p> T: Reactions that have metabolites in multiple compartments. This can only happen<br> at membranes, involving transport reactions or electron transfer reactions (ETRs).<br> These reactions may use only the generic directional compartments CCO-IN and<br> CCO-OUT for their metabolites, which need to be mapped to the actual compartments<br> in a given PGDB for certain operations.</p>
<p> The values of this slot differ between these cases.</p>
<p> S: If this reaction occurs in a non-default compartment, or in several compartments,<br> then this slot stores for every compartment the corresponding frame (a child of<br> CCO-SPACE). In cases where this slot contains a value, and the reaction also occurs<br> in the cytosol, then CCO-CYTOSOL must be included as a slot value.</p>
<p> T: This slot contains one or more frames that are children of CCO-MEMBRANE ,<br> or potentially symbols that have to be unique in this slot, for situations where the<br> metabolites are in spaces that are not directly adjacent to one membrane, or when 3<br> spaces are involved (such as if the transporter spans two membranes). If the reaction<br> was not assigned to any particular membrane, then no value is stored, which is the<br> default case.<br> Additionally, each slot value in this slot will have annotations with the labels<br> CCOIN and CCO-OUT, and in the rare case of 3 compartments involved, also another<br> label called CCO-MIDDLE. The values of each of these annotations have to be one valid<br> child of CCO-SPACE. These annotations define the mappings between the COMPARTMENT<br> annotation values, which the metabolites have that are listed in the reaction’s Left<br> and Right slots, and the final compartments in this PGDB.<br> Every metabolite in the reaction’s Left and Right slots needs to have a COMPARTMENT<br> annotation, the value of which needs to be one of CCO-IN, CCO-OUT, or possibly<br> CCO-MIDDLE in complex situations.</p>
<p> If the reaction is catalyzed by more than one enzyme (i.e. it has more than one<br> enzymaticreaction attached), then each value in the RXN-LOCATIONS slot has to have an<br> annotation called ENZRXNS, which has as its values the frame IDs of the corresponding<br> enzymatic-reactions. This allows determining the precise compartment(s) in which the<br> catalyzed reaction is occurring.<br> Whenever a reaction is transferred between PGDBs (by import or schema upgrade operations),<br> all values in the RXN-LOCATIONS are filtered away (i.e. not copied). This<br> prevents inapplicable compartments from being introduced into other PGDBs.</p>
<h4 id="Species"><a href="#Species" class="headerlink" title="Species"></a>Species</h4><p>This slot is used to indicate that a reaction is known to occur in an organism in the case<br> where the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is unknown. In such cases, the value for this<br> slot in a given reaction would be the symbolic identifier of the species for the organism<br> for the current PGDB.</p>
<h4 id="Spontaneous"><a href="#Spontaneous" class="headerlink" title="Spontaneous"></a>Spontaneous</h4><p>This slot is true in the case when this reaction occurs spontaneously, that is, it is not<br> catalyzed by any enzyme.</p>
<h4 id="Substrates"><a href="#Substrates" class="headerlink" title="Substrates"></a>Substrates</h4><p>The value of this slot is computed automatically — its values may not be changed by the<br> user. The values of the slot are computed as the union of the values of the Left and Right<br> slots.</p>
